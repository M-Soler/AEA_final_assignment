    "In this notebook I will compose an index measuring the best European trade partners for each country. A large amount of trade can be simply explained through the Gravity model of trade, which, just like the Gravity in physics, it is only concerned in mass (size of the economy) and the distance from each other. Therefore, as both variables have an exogenous nature, I will be creating an index showing the amount of trade for each European country after controlling for the effect of the Gravity model. By doing this, I hope to be able to show country levels of trade despite their natural trade barriers, and therefore be able to create an index showing the countries which have the best and worst trade relationships with each other."

    "# Motivation \n",

    "My main motivation on creating this index came from the following map: <img src=\"MajorTradingPartners.jpg\">\n",
    "Author: u/JohnPaokJeff\n",
    "\n",
    "The map shows the major trading partner in Europe and its surrounding areas, however it does not provide much insight as it is simply the result of the Gravity model: countries trade most with the country with the largest economy which is relatively closer to them.\n",
    "Therefore, I believe controlling for this effect would lead to a much more insightful map as it would show the country's biggest trade partners based on how good their trade relationships are instead of simply their size and proximity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Being able to display each country's best and worst trade partners would be insightful as it would illustrate the complex environment of international trade within a simple ranking system. Furthermore, I expect many smaller countries to unexpectedly show up high on a country's rankings as these are normally overshadowed by the main economic powerhouses of Europe."

    "There are many interesting observation points we can point out through this ranking system.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of the Netherlands, we see that its top three trade partners are small island nations. A possible explanation for this is the importance of the Rotterdam port. \n",
    "As Rotterdam has the biggest port in Europe and the small island nations of Iceland, Cyprus, and Malta largely depend on trade through naval routes, it is likely that these countries are trading with mainland Europe through the port of Rotterdam, and therefore, their trade with the Netherlands is inflated. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of Russia, Netherland's fourth trade partner, its relationship is based on the oil industry, which results in almost 90% of the Dutch imports from Russia. The Netherlands does not only import oil from Russia for their own consumption, but it also then sent to the rest of the continent through European supply pipes or sent to the rest of the world through bulk carriers. \n",

    "The map above shows a great variety of countries; however, we can identify a few themes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Central and Nordic Europe are dominated by Iceland and Macedonia. In the case of Iceland, it is simple to think that Iceland's best trade partners are those who have ports in the North Sea. However, it is challenging to find a connection between Macedonia and Czechia, Germany, Slovenia, and the United Kingdom. \n",
    "\n",
    "The prevalence of small countries such as Cyprus, Iceland, and Malta might be result of a bias within the model. A possible idea to rectify this issue would be to include other geographical data within the model. Controlling for geographical features which impact trade such as being an island or a landlocked country as well as the roughness of the terrain in a country's borders (Alps, Pyrenees).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can observe some economic isolation within The Ex-Yugoslav countries, every single country has another Ex-Yugoslav country as their best trading partner. The only other place where we observe a similar cluster is in the Baltic region, where both Latvia and Lithuania have Estonia as their best trading partner while Estonia itself has Lithuania as its top trading partner. In both cases, this might be explained by their shared recent history, as most of these countries did not exist separate from each other until the 1990's. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, this map shows much greater variety over the first map shown in the introduction. After controlling for economic size and distance, we observe a much different picture, however, while we can still spot several patterns, it would be extremely challenging to thoroughly explain every single outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, this ranking system can be useful in order to determine both the best trading partners of a country.\n",
    "However, it could be even more beneficial to identify possible opportunities for a country by trying to understand why they have a poor rank for a specific trading partner. Through a policy point of view, a country might want to allocate resources into growing their trading relationship with another country."
